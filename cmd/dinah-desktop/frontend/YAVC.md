# yavc.app content release

`yavc/` holds the portable Editor, Docs, Diagrams and Slides applets from yavc.app, as one release set, unchanged. The plan for adopting them is [docs/design/content-applets.md](../../../docs/design/content-applets.md).

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Producer | https://github.com/paulmooreparks/yavc.app |
| Release | v0.2.82, commit `bc48ff95c687be812e9e5f925c20e51f8bed1c8a`, downloaded from the release's assets (`yavc-content-v0.2.82.zip`, SHA-256 `fa3b8630e8dbfd55575d562cf8299629f28c869e20489bef926b2b27c731e6b0`) |
| Manifest digest | `9ceb34c2cb48f2578e9a0f1974be3deff9080cb0c033e88a17c163a4a9c9d4f6` |
| Applets | Editor 46.37.1, Docs 1.37.1, Diagrams 0.44.1, Slides 0.65.1 |
| PUDL | 0.107.1, the same release Dinah ships in `pudl/` |

The release's own `manifest.json` is kept beside it. Dinah ships the release's `content/`, `support/` and `LICENSE`. It leaves out the release's `pudl/`, because Dinah's copy is the same release byte for byte, and its demonstration hosts (`lab/`, `workspace-lab/`) with their `go.mod` and `go.sum`. `yavc_release_test.go` checks the aggregate digest, and the length and SHA-256 of every file, against Dinah's tree and Dinah's PUDL.

To take another release, download its three assets (`yavc-content-VERSION.zip`, `.manifest.json` and `.sha256`) from the release at https://github.com/paulmooreparks/yavc.app/releases, check the ZIP's SHA-256 against the published one, extract it into an empty folder, compare the archive's `manifest.json` with the published manifest and verify the digest and every file, then replace `yavc/` whole with the same parts and change the digest in `yavc_release_test.go` and the table above. yavc.app's `docs/content-release-downloads.md` describes the assets. Nothing in `yavc/` is edited by hand; a change goes to yavc.app.
